# Pomodoro Timer Widget

This is a simple Pomodoro timer built using React.

## Description

A Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that uses time blocking techniques to aid focus and productivity. The timer counts down from a specified number of minutes, allowing the user to focus on work for that period of time before taking a short break. The standard time for one Pomodoro is 25 minutes, but this example uses 1 minute for the sake of simplicity.

This Pomodoro Timer Component is built using React and uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage state and side effects.

## Features

- **Start/Pause Button**: This button starts or pauses the timer. When the timer is active, the button shows "Pause", and when it is inactive, it shows "Start".

- **Reset Button**: This button resets the timer back to the initial time.

## Installation

To use this component, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. 

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the application using `npm start`

Please note that this component is designed to be used within a larger React application. You'll need to import the component and include it in your application's component tree to use it.

## Possible Improvements

While this Pomodoro Timer Widget serves its basic functionality, there are multiple areas where it can be improved:

- Adding audio cues when the timer reaches 0.
- Adding the ability to customize the length of the Pomodoro and break periods.
- Adding the ability to perform multiple Pomodoros in a row, with breaks in between.
